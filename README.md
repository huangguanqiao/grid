## Align Content
align-content positions the rows along the column axis, or from top to bottom, and is declared on grid containers.

It accepts these positional values:

- start — aligns the grid to the top of the grid container
- end — aligns the grid to the bottom of the grid container
- center — centers the grid vertically in the grid container
- stretch — stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand vertically across the container
- space-around — includes an equal amount of space on each side of a grid element, resulting in double the amount of space between elements as there is before the first and after the last element
- space-between — includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end
- space-evenly — places an even amount of space between grid items and at either end
